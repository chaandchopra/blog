So, its no surprise that (on average) in an 8-hour workday, people\r\n are productive for <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/in-an-8-hour-day-the-average-worker-is-productive-for-this-many-hours.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">only 3 hours</a> or so.</p>\r\n<p>Plus, not taking breaks <a href=\"https://www.instantprint.co.uk/printspiration/be-inspired/this-is-what-happens-when-you-dont-take-a-break-from-work\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">comes with</a> other negative effects:</p>\r\n<ul><li>Decision fatigue</li><li>Lack of focus</li><li>Damaged eyes</li></ul>\r\n<p>The good news is:</p>\r\n<p>As behavioral scientist Nir Eyal <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/5-research-backed-ways-to-take-better-breaks-2017-4?amp&amp;utm_content=buffer1730c&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explains</a>,\r\n the right kind of breaks can counter these negative effects. Good \r\nbreaks reduce mental fatigue, boost brain function, and help us stay \r\nfocused.</p>\r\n<p>But taking too many breaks can backfire, too Because when you take the wrong kind of breaks it actually gets HARDER to focus.</p>\r\n<p>So, if you want to get more done, you need to make sure you take effective breaks during your workday.</p>\r\n<p>Thats just how our brain works</p>\r\n<h3>How does taking a break affect my brain?</h3>\r\n<p>Most of us are knowledge workers  we think for a living. And the thinking part of our brain is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prefrontal cortex</a>:</p>\r\n<p>The prefrontal cortex is where our focus, decision making, and \r\nlogical thinking happens. Thats pretty much what most of us do all day.\r\n So, no wonder our brain needs a break!</p>\r\n<p>It turns out, though, our brain isnt doing nothing when we rest</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691612447308\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Research</a>\r\n from the University of Southern California that suggests that our brain\r\n uses the downtime to make important connections that shape our identity\r\n and social behavior  things like recalling personal memories, \r\nimagining the future, and developing a code of ethics.</p>\r\n<p>Thats why giving your brain a chance to rest is crucial.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, here are the most important, scientifically-backed benefits:</p>\r\n<h3>What are the most important benefits of taking a break at work?</h3>\r\n<p>When you DONT take breaks its bad for your productivity and health.</p>\r\n<p>On the flipside</p>\r\n<p>When you DO take breaks, there are lots of advantages.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Heres a quick summary of the most important benefits:</strong></p>\r\n<ul><li>Taking regular breaks will help you make better decisions (by thinking more clearly)</li><li>Breaks spark creative ideas and new solutions</li><li>Taking breaks helps you stay focused over long periods of time</li><li>Breaks can help you retain information in memory (important for studying or rehearsing a speech etc.)</li><li>Taking short breaks every now and then help you re-focus on your big-picture goals.</li></ul>\r\n<p>How do you take advantage of all of this?</p>\r\n<p>By taking the right number, length, and type of break.</p>\r\n<h3>Does Taking a Break Help Me Make Better Decisions?</h3>\r\n<p>Yes! Heres why</p>\r\n<p>Breaks prevent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">decision fatigue</a>:</p>\r\n<p>As you work, you constantly have to make decisions. But this actually wears down our willpower and ability to think clearly.</p>\r\n<p>For example, one famous <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> showed:</p>\r\n<p>Judges were less and less likely to grant parole to prisoners later \r\nin the day. Decision fatigue explains why this happens Without taking \r\nbreaks, the judges were more likely to go with the easiest decision: \r\njust say no.</p>\r\n<p>Thats tragic in this case. But it applies to ALL decisions. Decisions wear us down over time.</p>\r\n<p>So, if you want to make better decisions, make sure you take regular breaks.</p>\r\n<h3>How does taking a break affect creativity?</h3>\r\n<p>Breaks serve as creative fuel.</p>\r\n<p>Ill explain.</p>\r\n<p>Being creative means connecting the dots. Specifically, connecting dots that you didnt think about connecting before</p>\r\n<p>Say, youre stuck trying to figure out a problem. A quick walk to the around the block can spark an idea for the solution.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe you read a funny slogan on a billboard. Maybe you overhear a \r\nconversation while you wait in line. Maybe a conversation with a friend \r\nturns into the Aha-moment that will get you unstuck.</p>\r\n<p>The point is:</p>\r\n<p>Most of us, when were working, are focused on output. Kind of like\r\n Im writing this article right now: Im focused on putting the words on\r\n the screen. BUT</p>\r\n<p>Without input, its much harder to create quality output.</p>\r\n<p>The good news is that even a short change of state in the form of a break can be the creative input you need.</p>\r\n<p>Thats why taking breaks is important if you want to <a href=\"https://socialtriggers.com/how-to-be-more-creative-and-unlock-your-best-ideas/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">be more creative</a> and come up with new solutions.</p>\r\n<h3>How will breaks affect my ability to focus?</h3>\r\n<p>Its getting harder and harder to <a href=\"https://socialtriggers.com/how-to-stay-focused/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stay focused at work</a></p>\r\n<p>but taking breaks can help.</p>\r\n<p>People used to think concentration is about forcing yourself to stay focused. But a recent <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110208131529.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> from the University of Illinois BUSTS that myth.</p>\r\n<p>First, the scientists confirmed what you already know from \r\nexperience: if you have to focus on a single task for a long time, after\r\n a while, your performance gets worse and worse.</p>\r\n<p>The solution? Psychology professor Alejandro Lleras explains:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Deactivating and reactivating your goals allows you to stay focused</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>In other words</p>\r\n<p><strong>Taking breaks helps you stay focused.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Staying focused on one task for a long time is something humans \r\nhavent been doing for too long. So, our minds just arent used to it.</p>\r\n<p>For this reason, the best thing to do if you need to concentrate for a\r\n long time is NOT to try and force yourself to stay focused</p>\r\n<p>but to impose short, mental breaks on yourself.</p>\r\n<h3>How will taking a break affect my memory?</h3>\r\n<p>Theres <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mental-downtime/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">evidence</a> that taking breaks helps us form memories. The brain uses the downtime to review and store new information.</p>\r\n<p>But what if you need to remember a lot of new information over a few \r\ndays? For example, studying for a test or preparing for a presentation.</p>\r\n<p>How should you structure your study sessions?</p>\r\n<p>Well, it depends</p>\r\n<p>New research by David F. Little of Northwestern University suggests that theres a <strong>memory threshold:</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you take a long break before you reach that threshold, you wont remember as much. So, youre better off NOT taking a break.</p>\r\n<p>So</p>\r\n<p>DONT study for 20 minutes, take a 30-minute break and then study for\r\n another 20 minutes. Youd be better off powering through the 40 minutes\r\n without a break.</p>\r\n<p>However</p>\r\n<p>Taking lots of mini-breaks might be even better.

Give your focus-muscle a chance to relax. \r\nJust a few minutes later, youll come back fresh.</p>\r\n<p>(Remember: the brain needs time to consolidate new information.)</p>\r\n<h3>How long should my break be?</h3>\r\n<p>Remember, our bodies naturally go through an ebb and flow of high and low energy. Ideally, you want to take advantage of that.</p>\r\n<p>So, what is the ideal length of your work breaks?</p>\r\n<p>After reviewing all the studies and research thats out there, heres my best advice:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Take SHORT breaks  say 5 to 15 minutes  every hour or so. \r\nTake a longer break  at least 30 minutes  every 2 to 4 hours \r\n(depending on your task).</strong></p>\r\n<p>I know thats pretty broad</p>\r\n<p>But unless you want to follow a super strict schedule, based on all the research, thats the best advice I can give.</p>\r\n<p>For a more exact schedule you could follow one of these methods:</p>\r\n<ul><li>Take a 17-minute break every 52 minutes (see the <a href=\"https://desktime.com/blog/17-52-ratio-most-productive-people/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Desktime study</a>)</li><li>Take a 5-minute break every 25 minutes (following the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pomodoro Technique</a>)</li><li>As a general rule: Take a 15-minute break for every hour of focused work.</li></ul>\r\n<p>Just remember to take a longer break every 2-4 hours, too.</p>\r\n<p>Another thing to remember is that top performers dont necessarily spend more total time working.</p>\r\n<p>But they DO spend more time completely focused.</p>\r\n<p>For example</p>\r\n<p>Researcher K. Anders Ericsson found that top performers (including \r\nmusicians, athletes, etc.) rarely work for more than four and a half \r\nhours per day! However they engage in so-called <strong>deliberate practice.</strong></p>\r\n<p>James Clear gives a good <a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">definition</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Deliberate practice refers to a special type of practice \r\nthat is purposeful and systematic. While regular practice might include \r\nmindless repetitions, deliberate practice requires focused attention and\r\n is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Its easy to see why breaks are crucial for this. Remember, taking a \r\nbreak helps your mind to stay focused and re-focus on your goals.</p>\r\n<p>Heres my personal focus routine to <a href=\"https://socialtriggers.com/how-to-stay-focused/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">get into the zone</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>What should I do DURING my break?</h3>\r\n<p>So, the ability to focus is what makes you more productive while you work. And taking breaks is crucial but</p>\r\n<p>What should you do during your break?</p>\r\n<p><strong>In short: Anything that gives your brain a chance to relax.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Hengchen Dai from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/09/research-were-too-busy-to-follow-the-rules\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">says</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Based on past research, we would expect that the more \r\nrelaxed and disengaged from work people feel during a break, the more \r\nlikely they will be to benefit from taking time off.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>So, you shouldnt to any work on your break.</p>\r\n<p>Duh.</p>\r\n<p>But this is important</p>\r\n<p>Its tempting do easy tasks that dont require your full attention during your break dont.</p>\r\n<p>Science clearly says:</p>\r\n<p><strong>If you want to be more productive overall, dont work during your break!</strong></p>\r\n<p>The whole goal of taking a break is to shift your attention. In fact, the goal is to stop concentrating at all.</p>\r\n<p>So lets look at some specific things you can do during your break. \r\nShould you go for a walk? Should you drink coffee? Should you take a \r\nnap?</p>\r\n<p>Ill answer those questions next.</p>\r\n<h3>Should I browse the internet during my breaks?</h3>\r\n<p>Yes and no.</p>\r\n<p>Ill explain.</p>\r\n<p>On the one hand, you want to completely take your mind off of work. And scrolling through Instagram or watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24HmeK-G-ElWkdGziH-VeA?sub_confirmation=1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">your favorite YouTube vlogger</a> can certainly do the trick.</p>\r\n<p>But theres a downside to goofing off online during your break, too</p>\r\n<p>The problem is that non-stop social media use <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-dick/social-networks-and-stress_b_3534170.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">increases stress</a>. And it gets worse. The Harvard Business Review <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/05/your-brain-on-facebook\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that social media can also hurt your ability to focus and learn.</p>\r\n<p>Basically, your brain gets hooked on instant gratification of seeing \r\nthe next Instagram picture. And then another one. And another one.</p>\r\n<p>This makes it harder and harder to focus on things thats not immediately as rewarding. You know, things like doing your job.</p>\r\n<p>Theres also a <a href=\"http://a.co/8TOKvjQ\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">South Korean study</a> that shows that tech-free breaks increase vigor and reduce emotional exhaustion.</p>\r\n<p><strong>So ideally, you want to stay away from your screen.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Now</p>\r\n<p>I cant say I dont browse the internet on my breaks.</p>\r\n<p>But would I recommend it?</p>\r\n<p>No.</p>\r\n<h3>How much should I move during my break?</h3>\r\n<p>When <a href=\"https://socialtriggers.com/hospital/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">I had a health scare</a> a couple of years ago, my doc told me to do one thing:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Walk.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ever since then, I walk everywhere.</p>\r\n<p>I do walking meetings. I make all my phone calls when I walk around NYC. We even did a <a href=\"https://socialtriggers.com/challenge/walking/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walking Challenge</a> here at Social Triggers to get people to walk more.</p>\r\n<p>So, needless to say, I believe walking is a GREAT thing to do during your break.</p>\r\n<p>Walking is essential for your physical and emotional health. It reduces stress and boosts creativity.</p>\r\n<p>The good news is:</p>\r\n<p>You dont have to exhaust yourself.</p>\r\n<p>A short 5 minute walk is enough.</p>\r\n<p>If you can, walk outside. Spending time in nature is ideal.</p>\r\n<p>But really, the big benefit comes from getting up</p>\r\n<p>Sitting all day is TERRIBLE for your health.</p>\r\n<p>Thats why just a little bit of movement during your break is so good\r\n for you. And thats even beyond all the positive effects of taking a \r\nbreak in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>So, you dont have to move a lot. But its important that you do.</p>\r\n<h3>Should I workout during my break?</h3>\r\n<p>As I mentioned, to get the benefit of an effective break, you dont need to move a lot.</p>\r\n<p>Does that mean you shouldnt workout during your break?</p>\r\n<p>No.</p>\r\n<p>You absolutely can.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/forget-brainstorming-74223\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Studies have shown</a> that a moderate level of cardio activity can boost creativity and productivity for upt to two hours.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Almost every dimension of cognition improves from 30 minutes of aerobic exercise.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Theres a slight catch, though If you dont work out regularly, you might be exhausted rather than refreshed form the workout.</p>\r\n<p>But remember:</p>\r\n<p>The good news is you dont need to work out that hard. A short walk \r\nis enough to get the benefit of taking a break AND reduce the negative \r\neffects of sitting all day.</p>\r\n<p>Exercise also reduces stress and anxiety. But I dont have to explain <a href=\"https://socialtriggers.com/my-fitness-journey/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">why staying fit is good for your productivity</a></p>\r\n<h3>Should I take a nap during my break?</h3>\r\n<p>Sciences says</p>\r\n<p>Yes.</p>\r\n<p>The power of a good nap is undeniable:</p>\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10607214\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Research</a>\r\n on pilots shows that a 26-minute in-flight nap (yes, there was a \r\ncopilot lol) enhanced performance by 34% and overall alertness by 54%.</li><li>A study published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nn864\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nature Neuroscience</a>\r\n tested how naps affect our perception throughout the day.

If you want to give yourself an extra boost, drink a cup \r\nof coffee right before The caffeine will kick in right as you get back \r\nto work.</li><li><strong>Take a 45-minute nap (but not more!):</strong> Naps of up to\r\n 45 minutes will also include REM sleep. This means you should see even \r\nmore benefits from your nap (like a boost in creative thinking).</li><li><strong>Take a loooong (90- to 120-minutes) nap:</strong> This will give you enough time to go through a full sleep cycle. So, you wont have to deal with sleep inertia.</li></ul>\r\n<p>But be careful. When you nap</p>\r\n<p><strong>Beware of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_inertia\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sleep inertia</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you sleep more than 45 minutes but not long enough to go through a\r\n full sleep-cycle, it might take you a long time to be fully awake \r\nagain.</p>\r\n<h3>Should I try to meditate on my break?</h3>\r\n<p>Okay, Ive tried meditating but I cant do it.</p>\r\n<p>Thats not to say, there are no benefits. And its definitely a great idea to do it during your breaks.</p>\r\n<p>Remember, the goal is to completely disconnect your brain from work. When you meditate, ideally, thats what youll experience.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/minding-the-body/201203/four-good-times-day-meditate-and-one-avoid\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">best practice</a> for meditating during a break is to do it during one of your longer breaks. Say, your lunch-break.</p>\r\n<h3>(What) Should I eat and drink during my break?</h3>\r\n<p>Our brains basically <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22436/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">run on glucose</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>The brain lacks fuel stores and hence requires a continuous supply of glucose.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Thats why its a great idea to fuel your brain during your breaks.</p>\r\n<p>Here a are some ideas for <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/best-snacks-to-eat-at-work-2015-4\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">healthy snacks</a>:</p>\r\n<ul><li>Almonds</li><li>Fresh fruit or dried fruit</li><li>Protein bar</li><li>Wasabi peas</li><li>Hummus and veggies</li><li>Kale chips</li><li>Tomato juice</li><li>Yogurt</li><li>Apples and peanut butter</li></ul>\r\n<p>So, go ahead and use your break as an opportunity to have a snack. Or vice versa</p>\r\n<p>Use your urge to snack as an opportunity to take a break!</p>\r\n<h3>Should I take a coffee break?</h3>\r\n<p>Should you actually drink coffee during your coffee break?</p>\r\n<p>As it turns out, yes, theres <a href=\"http://ceoworld.biz/2018/01/15/7-reasons-why-you-should-drink-coffee-at-work/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">evidence</a> that drinking coffee is good for your productivity Caffeine keeps you alert, it can reduce stress, and keep you active.</p>\r\n<p>Now, lets say you take 2 coffee breaks. And lets say you wake up between 6 am and 8 am</p>\r\n<p><strong>When should you take your coffee breaks?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Apparently, the perfect time for your first coffee break is between \r\n9:30 am and 11:30 am. Then, your second coffee break should be between \r\n1:30 pm and 5:30 pm.</p>\r\n<p>Oh and remember: You can <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/the-secret-to-being-a-productive-human-take-more-breaks-and-naps\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">drink coffee right before you take a 20-minute nap</a>, too. That way, when you wake up, youll get the jolt of caffeine at the perfect time.</p>\r\n<p>Now</p>\r\n<p>It looks like drinking coffee is pretty good for your productivity. \r\nBut whether you like to drink coffee, water, or tea, theres another \r\nbenefit of the typical coffee break:</p>\r\n<p>Its often a good opportunity meet and talk to people.</p>\r\n<p>So, lets summarize</p>\r\n<h3>So what are the best activities to do during my break?</h3>\r\n<p>Remember:</p>\r\n<p>The goal of your breaks should be to fully detach from work  even if its just for a moment.</p>\r\n<p>So, Ill say it again Dont try to combine your break with another \r\nstressful activity. Dont do light work like checking emails. If \r\nyoure chatting with someone, dont talk about work issues.</p>\r\n<p>In his book <a href=\"http://a.co/8TOKvjQ\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing</a>, Dan Pink cites a South Korean study to prove this point:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Psychological detachment from work, in addition to \r\nphysical detachment, is crucial, as continuing to think about job \r\ndemands during breaks may result in strain.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>With that in mind, what are some good activities to do during your break?</p>\r\n<p>How about you</p>\r\n<ul><li><strong>Go for a short walk</strong>  sitting all day is bad for you. Moving is better than being stationary.</li><li><strong>Go outside</strong>  spending time in nature will boost your creativity and ability to focus.</li><li><strong>Stretch</strong>  whatever you need to do to get a moment to relax</li><li><strong>Take a nap</strong>  the power of a good nap is undeniable.</li><li><strong>Daydream</strong>  the less youre concentrating, the better (it will ease stress and boost your mood).</li><li><strong>Declutter your desk or doodle</strong>  this should get your mind off work for a moment (and help you come back re-focused).</li><li><strong>Talk to people</strong>  friends and co-workers</li><li><strong>Give your eyes a break</strong>  Look away from your screen for at least 20 seconds every 20 minutes (the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/5591835/reduce-computer-caused-eye-strain-with-the-20-20-20-rule\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">20-20-20 rule</a>)</li><li><strong>Have a snack/take a coffee break</strong>  your brain needs fuel to work properly.</li></ul>\r\n<p>Whatever you do, the qualities of a good break remain the same.

Every day?</p>\r\n<p>The first problem is that most people feel GUILTY about taking any kind of break:</p>\r\n<p>According to one <a href=\"http://investor.staples.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=96244&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1928035&amp;highlight=\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>, only 25% of people take more than a lunch break. Most people just power through their 8+ hours of work.</p>\r\n<p>This is based on a deep rooted belief</p>\r\n<p>Many cultures just see taking breaks as being lazy.</p>\r\n<p>But as weve seen, thats not true.</p>\r\n<p>So why do we still feel guilty about taking breaks?</p>\r\n<h3>I feel guilty about taking breaks. What should I do?</h3>\r\n<p>The first thing you should do is</p>\r\n<p>Stop feeling guilty about taking breaks.</p>\r\n<p>Easier said than done, I know.</p>\r\n<p>But at least now, you have all the evidence that proves: Taking breaks actually makes you MORE productive.</p>\r\n<p>Depending on the work you do, it can be critical that you take enough breaks. Which reminds me of a recent uber driver</p>\r\n<p>He told me, man, Ive been driving for 12 hours. Im gonna call it quits for the day soon. Lol. Yeah, you probably should.</p>\r\n<p>Or take the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/09/research-were-too-busy-to-follow-the-rules\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> that found that doctors stop washing their hands as the day goes on if they dont take enough breaks.</p>\r\n<p>Or let me remind you of top athletes that only practice for 3-4 hours\r\n a day. The difference is Theyre highly focused WHEN they work.</p>\r\n<p>Im not saying you need to take a 90-minute nap every day.</p>\r\n<p>But if you do, thats okay, too.</p>\r\n<p>As long as it helps you come back to work with fresh focus, better \r\nmood, and more motivation, theres absolutely no need to feel guilty \r\nabout taking a break.</p>\r\n<p>But dont take it from me</p>\r\n<p>Tony Schwartz is the head of the productivity consulting firm <a href=\"https://theenergyproject.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Energy Project</a> (they advise companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple).

Youre using a \r\ndifferent part of your brain.</p>\r\n<p>Speaking of switching tasks:</p>\r\n<p>I recently read an interesting story about Elon Musk. <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-daily-schedule-2017-6\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apparently</a>, he breaks up his entire day into 5-minute slots.</p>\r\n<p>If youre actually THAT busy, dividing your day into smaller chunks can give your productivity a boost.</p>\r\n<p>You dont have to go as far as Musk. But how about 15- or 30-minute slots?</p>\r\n<p>Youll be surprised <a href=\"https://socialtriggers.com/how-to-stay-focused/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">what you can achieve when you truly focus</a> for half an hour. Then, youll feel like you have time for a break, too.</p>\r\n<h3>How can I make breaks a regular part of my routine?</h3>\r\n<p>So you want to make taking breaks a part of your routine.</p>\r\n<p>Thats the GOAL.</p>\r\n<p>But it can be difficult. Especially if youre busy and driven like \r\nmost entrepreneurs are. Thats why you need a system that automatically \r\nmakes breaks a regular part of your day.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Here are 3 good approaches:</strong></p>\r\n<ol><li><strong>Schedule breaks on your calendar:</strong> If youre working\r\n on a strict schedule, blocking time out for breaks on your calendar is \r\nyour best bet  even if its just two 15-minute breaks.</li><li><strong>Set a timer:</strong> If you do a lot of high-focus work, \r\nworking in sprints seems the most productive approach. You can use \r\nsome version of the Pomodoro Method and set a timer for 30-minutes, go \r\nwith the 52-minute work and 17-minute break intervals, or whichever time\r\n is optimal for you.</li><li><strong>Make a break appointment:</strong> If youre having a hard\r\n time sticking to your break schedule, make an appointment with someone \r\nto take your breaks together. Its a bit tricky to get on the same \r\nschedule. But this way youll have someone to remind you to take a \r\nbreak.</li></ol>\r\n<p>There are some great tools that can help you, too</p>\r\n<h3>What tools can I use to help me take breaks?</h3>\r\n<p>There are lots of easy-to-use time-tracking apps.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some popular apps:</p>\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.focusboosterapp.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Focus Booster app</a></li><li><a href=\"https://desktime.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DeskTime</a></li><li><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flowtime/ogaicamnmocpjcbcfpnaccmmhpfmogbb\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FlowTime</a></li><li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/be-focused-focus-timer/id973130201\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Be Focused  Focus Timer</a></li></ul>\r\n<p>Honestly? They all do the same thing. Most of these are too fancy for me. I like to keep it simple and distraction-free.</p>\r\n<p>Thats why my favorite tool is Google.</p></div>','2018-10-20','18:09:26'),(3,'Rahul','rahul@rohan.com','8723671209','Passing data over various webpages','Sending data by POST method','<br><div class=\"post\"><h2>POST Method Example Using Form</h2>\r\n<p>Let us do a little modification in the above JSP to handle both the GET and the POST method.
